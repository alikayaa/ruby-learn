	All if operators

	if age <= 18
	if age < 18
	if age > 18
	if age >= 18
	if age == 18
	if age != 18
	
	Additional logic

	if age > 7 && age < 18
	if age > 7 || age < 21

	Please note that, Ruby does this via short-circuit evaluation. 
	That means that Ruby doesnâ€™t look at both expressions unless it has to; if it sees false && true
	it stops reading as soon as it sees && because it knows false && anything must be false.

	&& results;
	true && true # => true
	true && false # => false
	false && true # => false
	false && false # => false

	|| results;
	true || true # => true
	true || false # => true
	false || true # => true
	false || false # => false

	! Not for boolean
	!true => false
	!false => true
